## Description

The mjl-ReadmeGenerator is, as its name suggests, a readme file generator. When run, it generates a markdown readme file (readme.md)
in the working directory after prompting the user for information needed to generate the file's content (project title, description, etc.). This application is built on the following technologies
- JavaScript, including the map method, the filter method, and the rest operator
- Node.js and File System (fs)
- The Inquirer package ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer))

You can see this app in action in [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vyaqC0DAXevtenfJjdDjmXHPry-4jnGZ/view?usp=sharing).

And you can see a sample readme file generated by this app at [./sampleReadme/README.md](./sampleReadme/README.md).
